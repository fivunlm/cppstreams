<p>TeamViewer complies with applicable data protection law. TeamViewer collects, processes and uses personal data of Customer in its function as a data controller as set out and in accordance with the relevant Product Privacy Notice available for download under <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/privacy-notice">https://www.teamviewer.com/en/privacy-notice</a>. Additionally, TeamViewer may act as a processor for Customer’s personal data as set out and in accordance with the terms and conditions of the <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/eula/#dpa">Data Processing Agreement (DPA)</a> provided separately under this link. The DPA does not apply if Customer is a natural person using the Software or the Services in the course of a purely personal or family activity (cf. Art. 2(2)(c) EU General Data Protection Regulation, “<strong>GDPR</strong>“).</p>
<h4>A.5. Non-personal data</h4>
<p>TeamViewer may process non-personal or anonymous data to improve functionality and the Customers’ experience with the Services. Customer agrees that TeamViewer owns all rights in and is free to use any such non-personal or anonymous data in any way it deems fit for development, diagnostic, corrective, security as well as marketing or any other purposes.</p>
<h4>A.6. Changes to the EULA</h4>
<p>TeamViewer shall be entitled to amend this EULA, especially – but not limited to – (i) to reflect changes in Services or in business, e.g. new products or features, services or technologies (ii) for legal, regulatory or security reasons and/or (iii) to prevent abuse or harm, upon no less than twenty-eight (28) days prior notice to Customer. Unless Customer notifies TeamViewer in writing of its objection to such amendment within fifteen (15) days of such notice, then the amendment shall be deemed accepted by Customer.

<p>The Contract contains the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all proposals, understandings, representations, warranties, covenants, and any other communications (whether written or oral) between the parties relating thereto and is binding upon the parties and their permitted successors and assigns. Any inconsistent or conflicting terms and conditions contained in any purchase order or similar instrument of Customer shall be of no force or effect, unless TeamViewer has explicitly approved such terms and conditions in writing. This requirement of explicit written form approval applies in particular to Customer’s terms and conditions, regardless of whether TeamViewer provides Software or Services to the Customer in knowledge of the Customer’s general terms and conditions without explicitly objecting to them.</p>
<h4>A.8. Warranties; no guarantees</h4>
<p>Warranties in this EULA refer to the description of remedies available to Customer in case of non-performance or defective performance and shall not be construed as a guarantee that stands for strict liability without fault. A guarantee of TeamViewer for quality or committed features in the meaning of preceding clause shall only be taken as such if made by TeamViewer in writing (including a signature) and labelled expressively as “guarantee”.</p>
<h4>A.9. Severability; waiver</h4>
<p>If any provision of the Contract is found partly or wholly invalid or unenforceable, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible, and remaining provisions of the Contract shall remain in full force and effect. A waiver of any breach or default under the Contract shall not constitute a waiver of any other subsequent breach or default.</p>
<h4>A.10. Communication via email</h4>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, any notifications and declarations in connection with the Contract may also be made by email. To this end, TeamViewer may use the email address the Customer provided upon registration or in the TeamViewer account.

The use for the exercise of Customer’s trade, business or profession, or the use for the purposes for which Customer directly or indirectly receives compensation (e. g. teamwork with colleagues, free support provided to third parties which have bought Customer’s own software or other product), shall not constitute personal usage.</p>

<p>Customer is responsible for the acts and omissions of its Authorized Users, as well as any other person that accesses and uses Services by using the access credentials provided by Customer, as its own acts and omissions.

<h5>B.1.5 Prohibited use</h5>
<p>Any use of Software and/or other Services that is not expressly granted is prohibited.

<h5>B.1.7 Source code</h5>

<h5>B.1.8 Usage analyses, right to audit and self-declaration</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may analyze Customer’s use of the Software and/or Services for security reasons as well as for product improvement, license auditing and/or marketing purposes. To that end, TeamViewer may use, at its sole discretion, and implement technical measures regarding the functionality of the Software and/or other Services to assess whether Customer’s usage pattern is in line with the indicated usage volume and thus with the chosen license type, and to detect whether the contractually agreed scope of use is being exceeded by Customer. TeamViewer may require Customer, at any time, to provide a self-declaration regarding its actual scope of use and/or usage pattern.</p>
<h4>B.2. Services</h4>
<h5>B.2.1 Product Specification</h5>
<p>The functions and features of the Software and / or other Services are set forth, respectively, in these Software Specific Terms, in the Product Specific Terms and/or, as the case may be, in an annex to the respective Contract (in each case, a “<strong>Product Specification</strong>”).</p>
<h5>B.2.2 Product Specification for Free Version</h5>
<p>A key element of and part of the Product Specification for the Free Version is the display and receipt of personalized marketing messages in the Software as well as the processing of personal data necessary to provide such personalization. In this context, the Free Version also requires cookies, including in certain cases third-party cookies, to be placed on a Customer’s devices, which enable TeamViewer and third-party recipients to analyze the Customer’s usage as well as online usage behavior. Detailed information on the purposes and exact implementation of personalization processes are described in TeamViewer’s Privacy and Cookie Notice.</p>
<h5>B.2.3 System Requirement</h5>
<p>Customer is responsible for providing the system environment required for the use of respective Software in accordance with the system requirements set forth in the Product Specific Terms (“<strong>System Requirement</strong>”).</p>
<h5>B.2.4 Provision, installation and configuration of Software</h5>
<p>Depending on the software types, Software may be provided for electronic download or made accessible via web browser. Customer shall be solely responsible for the download, installation and configuration of the Software. Customized adjustment, development, integration with Customer´s system or external software, training of Customer´s staff, as well as any additional consulting or support services other than warranty claims provided hereunder, are not included in the scope of Services and shall be subject to express written agreement.</p>
<h5>B.2.5 Server Services</h5>
<p>For the establishment of encrypted remote communication connections between different users of the Software, the Software must communicate with servers of TeamViewer (so-called “<strong>handshake</strong>”). In addition, it may be necessary for the transmission of data in the context of a session (e. g. online meeting or remote maintenance) that encrypted data packets be forwarded by servers of TeamViewer (so-called “<strong>routing</strong>”). Such handshake and routing are made available in connection with TeamViewer’s Server Services.</p>
<p>TeamViewer provides Customer with the Server Services subject to the conditions set out in this EULA. Customer acknowledges that the Server Services may be unavailable or include latency from time to time due to causes beyond the reasonable control of TeamViewer. Additionally, Customer acknowledges that the end-to-end connection between different users of the Software is dependent on Customer’s internet connection to the data center as well as Customer’s use of hardware and software (e. g. PC, operating system) in compliance with System Requirements for the Software, all of which shall not be included in the services provided by TeamViewer and shall be Customer’s responsibility at its own costs.</p>
<p>In case of Free Version, Customer has no claim to demand the provision of the Server Services and TeamViewer may in its sole discretion discontinue or modify the Server Services at any time.</p>
<h5>B.2.6 TeamViewer account</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may require Customer (and its Authorized Users) to sign up for a TeamViewer account and being logged in to the TeamViewer account to be able to use the Services. TeamViewer may further set certain account verification requirements that Customer will be required to meet to use the Services.</p>
<h5>B.2.7 Telephone conference number</h5>
<p>If, in the context of its Services, TeamViewer provides a telephone conference number for dialing in as an alternative to the audio conference function of the Software, the provider of the respective telecommunication service (and not TeamViewer) shall be solely responsible for the telephone connection of the respective number. The use of the telephone conference number may be subject to a separate fee charged by the respective provider.</p>
<h5>B.2.8 Programming interfaces</h5>
<p>At TeamViewer’s discretion, it may provide use of programming interfaces or other software interfaces (“<strong>API</strong>”) which may enable applications of third parties or of Customer (collectively “<strong>Third-party Software</strong>”) to communicate with the Software or the servers provided by TeamViewer as part of the Server Services. TeamViewer, in its sole discretion, may change or switch off APIs at any time without any obligation or liability to Customer. The respective provider shall be responsible for the Third-party Software. The provisions of the Contract shall not apply to any such Third-party Software and TeamViewer is under no obligation to test, validate or otherwise review Third-party Software, and shall have no liability for any Third-party Software or in connection with the use thereof.</p>
<h5>B.2.9 Changes to the Services</h5>
<p>Some features and functions of the Software or other Services provided by TeamViewer may include or depend on certain third-party components which may be subject to changes by such third parties. TeamViewer is entitled to modify or limit such features and functions, provided this does not materially interfere with the substantial functions of Services.</p>
<p>TeamViewer reserves the right to change the Software in the context of updates and/or Release Versions as well as the other Services (including the System Requirements) for good cause. Such good cause exists especially if the change is required due to (i) a necessary adaptation required by applicable law, regulation, court order, or order of authority; (ii) changes to applicable technical framework conditions (e.g., new encryption standards); or (iii) the protection of system security.</p>
<h5>B.2.10 Release Versions</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may, at its sole discretion, but shall not be obligated to, provide releases of the Software for download (“<strong>Release Versions</strong>”). Additional features to the Software which are separately marketed and/or priced by TeamViewer (“<strong>Additional Features</strong>”) shall not qualify as Release Versions. All rights of use set forth in the Contract applicable to the Software shall also apply to Release Versions.</p>
<p>Customer is obliged to update the Software with any Release Version at its own cost as soon as reasonably practicable. Customer’s systems shall comply with the System Requirements to accommodate new Release Versions. Any malfunctioning of the Software or failure in the Services that is attributable to non-compliance with this section shall be Customer’s sole responsibility.</p>
<p>The obligation of Customer holding a previously acquired perpetual license to update the Software shall be limited to the minor Release Versions (e.g., version XX.1, XX.2 “<strong>Minor Release Version</strong>”) relating to the main version (e.g., version XX, YY) for which the Perpetual License was acquired. Minor Release Versions may contain the correction of errors, security patches as well as minor improvements of functions (e.g., optimizations in the program execution speed) and will be marked by TeamViewer – in its sole discretion – by a change in the number behind the main version number.</p>
<h5>B.2.11 Software Lifecycle Policy</h5>
<p>Use of the Software shall be subject to TeamViewer’s Software Lifecycle Policy available for download under this link: <a href="https://dl.teamviewer.com/docs/en/TeamViewer-Software-Lifecycle-Policy-en.pdf">https://dl.teamviewer.com/docs/en/TeamViewer-Software-Lifecycle-Policy-en.pdf</a></p>

<p>Customer shall use the Software and / or other Services only in accordance with the provisions of the Contract and in accordance with laws and regulations applicable to such use, in particular all applicable data protection and export control provisions and shall not infringe any third-party rights in connection with such use.</p>
<h5>B.3.2 Export controls and economic sanctions</h5>
<p>Customer acknowledges that the Software and related technical data as well as the Services (collectively “<strong>Controlled Technology</strong>”) are subject to the import and export control and economic sanctions laws of Germany, the European Union and the United States, specifically the U.S. Export Administration Regulations (EAR) and the laws of any country where Controlled Technology is imported or re-exported.

<p>The maintenance by TeamViewer set out herein does not include (i) any adaptation of the Software to new operating systems or new operating system versions, (ii) adaptation of the Software to the scope of functions of competing products, (iii) establishment of compatibility with new data formats or Release Versions or (iv) provision of any functionality which is no longer supported by TeamViewer.</p>
<h5>B.4.3 Error elimination</h5>
<p>Customer may report any Errors in the Services preferably via the web portal provided by TeamViewer under the link <a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/customer-support/">https://www.teamviewer.com/en/customer-support/</a>. “<strong>Error</strong>” means any defect or malfunction that causes (i) the Software or Server Services to fail to perform the substantial functionality and/or expressly committed features in the respective Subscription, or (ii) the use of the Services by Customer to be unavailable or impaired in material aspects. Minor or immaterial deviations from the agreed or assumed characteristics or just slight impairment of use shall not be deemed as Errors.</p>
<p>TeamViewer shall use commercially reasonable efforts to eliminate Errors within a reasonable period of time following Customer’s notification of such Errors, for which Customer shall provide comprehensive details of the circumstances relating to the Errors and supporting documentation (e.g., screenshots, protocol data) in its notification, as far as this is possible and can be reasonably expected. TeamViewer may, at its sole option, eliminate Errors by delivering patches or updates, through Release Versions or otherwise. If the elimination of an Error is not available using financially reasonable efforts within a predictable time, TeamViewer shall be entitled to provide temporary workarounds for such Error, provided that the functionalities and availability of the Services are not materially affected.</p>
<h5>B.4.4 Infringement of third party right</h5>
<p>If Software infringes a third party’s patent or copyright, TeamViewer will, at its sole discretion: (i) obtain for Customer the right to continue using the Software; or (ii) replace or modify the Software so that it no longer infringes the relevant intellectual property right. If neither of the remedies in (i) or (ii) are reasonably available, either Party shall have the right to terminate the Contract with immediate effect.</p>
<h5>B.4.5 Claims for damages</h5>
<p>Any potential claims for damages based on a breach of warranty or defective performance shall be subject to the limitation of liability stipulated in the Jurisdiction Specific Terms.</p>
<h5>B.4.6 No warranty for Free License</h5>
<p>Software and / or other Services under Free License are provided as-is. TeamViewer assumes therefore no maintenance obligations and no warranty in relation to Customer holding a Free License, except in the case of fraudulent concealment of defect.</p>
<h5>B.4.7 Limitation period</h5>
<p>Customer´s remedies and claims for defects shall expire twelve (12) months after the circumstances giving rise to the claim have been discovered by Customer or, in the event of ignorance, twelve (12) months after Customer should reasonably have been aware of them. This shall not apply to the case of fraudulent concealment of defect, or a guarantee period expressly granted by TeamViewer for a longer period.</p>
<h4>B.5. Term and Termination</h4>
<h5>B.5.1 Term, auto-renewal and ordinary termination of Subscription</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise specified in the Contract, the initial term of the Contract for Subscription shall be twelve (12) months (“<strong>Initial Term</strong>”) and automatically renewed for subsequent periods of twelve (12) months (each a “<strong>Renewal Term</strong>”), unless either party notifies the other party no less than twenty-eight (28) calendar days prior to the end of the Initial Term or any Renewal Term that the Contract shall not renew. Ordinary termination rights are excluded during the Initial or Renewal Term.</p>
<h5>B.5.2 Term and ordinary termination of Free Version</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise specified, the Contract for Free Version shall be concluded for an unlimited period of time. Either party may terminate the Contract at any time.</p>
<p>The continued use of Free Version by Customer shall be deemed as acceptance of the terms of this EULA (including without limitation to the Product Specification of Free Versions) and continuation of the Contract thereunder. This shall also apply if Customer indicates disagreement with the EULA by any act or declaration but still uses the Free Version thereafter.</p>
<h5>B.5.3 Extraordinary termination</h5>
<p>TeamViewer shall be entitled to extraordinarily terminate the Contract for breach in case of sections B.1.5 (Prohibited use), B.3.1 (Lawful use), B.3.2 (Export controls and economic sanctions), A.4 (Data protection), A.2.6 (Late payment). To the extent a DPA is required in accordance with section A.4, lack of such DPA or termination thereof shall also constitute cause for termination of the Contract. Either party’s right to terminate for good cause remains unaffected.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the above, termination by the Customer based on non-performance of service in conformity with the Contract shall only be admissible if TeamViewer had been given enough opportunities to eliminate the error/shortcoming and has failed to do so or the subsequent performance was unsuccessful.</p>
<h5>B.5.4 Termination notice</h5>
<p>Termination notice, including the notification of non-renewal of Subscription pursuant to section B.5.1, must be made in text form (by signed letter, telefax or email). Customer shall address its termination notice to TeamViewer Germany GmbH, Bahnhofsplatz 2, 73033 Göppingen, Germany, or by email to sales@teamviewer.com, or using the web portal provided by TeamViewer under the link:<a href="https://www.teamviewer.com/en/customer-support/"> https://www.teamviewer.com/en/customer-support/</a>. TeamViewer may also terminate a Contract by means of a respective notification within the Software.</p>
<h5>B.5.5 Consequences of termination</h5>
<p>Upon termination or expiration of the Contract: (i) the granted License shall end forthwith, and Customer shall delete the Software from its computers and refrain from any further use of the Software; (ii) Customer shall no longer have access to the data stored in the Software, the TeamViewer account and the TeamViewer Management Console. Customer shall be solely responsible for exporting the data – as far as possible – prior to the termination or expiration of the term of the Contract by means of the Software functions and to store it for further use. TeamViewer shall not be obligated to any further release of data. (iii) TeamViewer’s right to use non-personal or anonymous data in accordance with section A.5. shall survive the termination and remain unaffected. Customer’s data that is processed for the purpose of performance of the Contract shall be deleted in compliance with applicable law, the Contract and the Data Processing Agreement, unless TeamViewer is obligated by law to store it. If a deletion is only possible with unreasonable efforts (e.g., in backups), TeamViewer shall be entitled to retain such data and restrict the further processing.</p>
<h4>B.6. Apple Specific Terms</h4>
<p>With respect to the use of the specific application of the Software for iOS operating system, available on the App Store (“<strong>TeamViewer iOS App</strong>”), the following provisions shall apply: Apple Inc. (“<strong>Apple</strong>”) is not a party to any Contract concluded under this EULA and does not own and is not responsible for the TeamViewer iOS App in any capacity or manner.

Any inquiries or complaints relating to the use of the TeamViewer iOS App, including those pertaining to intellectual property rights, must be directed to TeamViewer in accordance with the notice provisions contained in this EULA. The license granted to Customer to use the TeamViewer iOS App is a limited non-transferable license for the use on an Apple-branded product that runs Apple’s iOS operating system and is owned or controlled by Customer, or as otherwise permitted by the Usage Rules set forth in Apple’s Mobile App Store Terms of Service, except that the TeamViewer iOS App may also be accessed and used by other accounts associated with Customer via Apple’s Family Sharing or volume purchasing programs. In addition, Customer must comply with the terms of any third-party agreement applicable to Customer when using the TeamViewer iOS App, such as Customer´s wireless data service agreement. Apple and Apple’s subsidiaries are third-party beneficiaries of this EULA and, upon Customer´s acceptance of this EULA, will have the right (and will be deemed to have accepted the right) to enforce this EULA against Customer as a third-party beneficiary thereof; notwithstanding the foregoing, TeamViewer’s right to enter into, rescind or terminate any variation, waiver or settlement under this EULA is not subject to the consent of any third party.</p>

<p>Where Customer Hosting is agreed between the parties, Customer shall ensure that the server infrastructure running the Server Software and all third-party software components required for the performance thereof, including operating systems, hardware drivers and auxiliary software is always updated to the latest version available by the respective manufacturer or publisher.</p>
<p>Failing such Update Obligations, TeamViewer shall not be liable for damages resulting therefrom.</p>
<p>TeamViewer provides no warranties or representations and shall subsequently not be liable for the Customer Hosting.</p>
<p>Where TeamViewer reasonably believes that the security or integrity of the Customer Hosting has been compromised, TeamViewer shall at its own discretion have the right to block any connection between the Customer Hosting and the TeamViewer Server Services until the underlying issue has been resolved. TeamViewer shall in such cases without undue delay notify Customer and provide relevant information in that respect.</p>
<p>Unless the parties expressly agree in writing to the contrary, if the Customer is a Covered Entity, Business Associate, or Representative of a Covered Entity or Business Associate (pursuant to the definition of these terms in 45 C.F.R § 160.103), the Customer agrees not to use any component, function, or other facility in order to create, receive, manage, or transmit any “protected health information” of any kind (pursuant to the definition of this term in 45 C.F.R § 160.103) that would result in TeamViewer being considered a Business Associate or a Representative of a Business Associate.</p>
<h5>D.6.2 Audit</h5>

<p>In addition, upon TeamViewer’s request, Customer shall make available additional information reasonably necessary to demonstrate compliance with the usage restrictions, including all limitations set out under the Contract.</p>
<p>Once a year, TeamViewer shall, in addition to the above, be entitled to audit the compliance with the terms of the Contract, by conducting an audit at the Customer’s premises, on which the Software is deployed. TeamViewer shall notify Customer no less than five (5) business days prior to such audit and conduct such audit during normal business hours, minimizing the business impact on Customer’s normal business operation. At TeamViewer’s sole discretion, TeamViewer shall have the right to have the audit performed by a duly authorized third party bound by obligations of confidentiality.</p>
<h5>D.6.3 Customer Content</h5>
<p>Within the Software, TeamViewer may make available to the Customer functions for uploading, storing or integrating content provided by Customer including but not limited to texts, graphics, audio or video files or other digital data and content (“<strong>Customer Content</strong>”).

<h3>E. Professional Services Specific Terms</h3>
<p><strong>The Professional Services Specific Terms contain the terms and conditions that apply to the provision of professional services by TeamViewer to support the use of TeamViewer Product(s), e. g. installation, configuration, customizations and integration of Services in Customer´s environment or third-party interface, as well as related IT services, consulting and training (collectively “Professional Services”).</strong></p>
<p><strong>“Customer” in this section E refers to the party who orders the Professional Services from TeamViewer, which might not be the same person (Customer in the context of section B of EULA) who acquires the License for the TeamViewer Product.</strong></p>
<h4>E.1. Subject Matter</h4>
<h5>E.1.1 Contractual basis</h5>
<p>The Professional Services are not included in a Contract for License and therefore the parties explicitly need to agree on the provision of such services. A Contract for Professional Services will be formed pursuant to section A. 1. (ii) or (iii).</p>
<h5>E.1.2 Contract for service</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stipulated in the Contract, the respective Contract on provision of Professional Services shall be deemed as a contract for service (for contracts governed by German Law, <em>Dienstvertrag</em> in the meaning of section 611 BGB (German Civil Code)), and the Professional Services shall be provided on a time and materials basis pursuant to section <strong>E. 5.</strong> The listed items of Professional Services in the quote or other transaction document serve only as a description of the service content and scope and shall not be interpreted as commitment of TeamViewer to a specific success of work, or deliverables fit for the intended use or business purposes of Customer.</p>
<h5>E.1.3 Service description</h5>
<p>TeamViewer will perform the Professional Services as described in the transaction documents forming the Contract, in the event of a conflict or inconsistency, in the following descending order:</p>
<ul>
<li>A transaction document (e. g. Scope of Work) specifying the service items and performance details in writing signed by both parties;</li>
<li>Any further requests, plans, policies or terms of Customer that might be accepted by TeamViewer in connection with a Contract, which shall be confirmed in writing (with signature) to be effective;</li>
<li>Service description in a binding quote provided by TeamViewer and accepted by Customer.</li>
</ul>
<h5>E.1.4 Retention of intellectual property rights; no transfer of title</h5>
<p>Except as otherwise expressly agreed to in writing by both parties by designating such deliverables as a “<strong>work for hire</strong>”, the transfer of title or granting of use right (licensing) is not a subject matter included in the service scope of Professional Services, and nothing in a Contract for Professional Services will otherwise function to transfer any of either party’s intellectual property rights to the other party, so each party will retain exclusive interest in and ownership of its own intellectual properties. The right of Customer to use any Materials or Work Results delivered by TeamViewer shall be subject to section E.6.</p>
<h5>E.1.5 Third-party service recipient</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may, insofar as agreed in the Contract, provide Professional Services on the device or network of a third-party appointed by Customer as service recipient (“<strong>Third-Party Service Recipient</strong>”). In this case, the Customer shall be liable for the acts and omission of the Third-Party Service Recipient in receiving the Professional Services as such of its own. The Third-Party Service Recipient is not a party to the Contract, nor shall it be a third-party beneficiary of the Contract. Any deviating contractual conditions, warranties and commitments regarding Professional Services agreed upon between Customer and such Third-Party Service recipient shall not be binding upon TeamViewer.</p>
<h4>E.2. Performance of Professional Services</h4>
<h5>E.2.1 Place of performance</h5>
<p>The Professional Services will be provided at the place of performance specified in the Contract. If no place of performance is stipulated, the Professional Services will be provided as remote service or at the premises of TeamViewer.</p>
<h5>E.2.2 Schedule</h5>
<p>The date of the Professional Services will be scheduled mutually by the parties. Unless otherwise agreed by the parties in writing, time is not of the essence; for contracts under German law, the provision of Professional Services shall not constitute an absolute fixed-date transaction (absolutes <em>Fixgeschäft</em>).</p>
<h5>E.2.3 Language</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise stipulated in writing by the Parties, the language of the Professional Services will be English.</p>
<h4>E.3. Requirements for the provision of services; Duties and obligations of Customer</h4>
<h5>E.3.1 Customer responsibilities</h5>
<p>The provision of Professional Services requires the fulfilment of certain technical requirements placed on the hard- and software as well as network environment which lies in the responsibility of Customer. Customer shall provide cooperation and promote the Professional Services in every phase through active and appropriate participation and contribution. In particular, it shall provide TeamViewer with the required access to and information, documents and data, IT infrastructure and other means necessary for the proper performance and proceeding of the Professional Services.</p>
<h5>E.3.2 On-site Services</h5>
<p>If the Professional Services shall be provided on-site and outside the business premises of TeamViewer, Customer shall provide at its own costs the corresponding premises and all technical requirements which are necessary for the purpose, especially the auxiliary equipment required under health and safety laws, the necessary hardware and software, transmission equipment, access, network connections and workspaces. Customer shall be obliged to take all necessary measures at the place of performance to protect the health and ensure the safety of TeamViewer engineers and other auxiliary personnel.</p>
<h5>E.3.3 Customer System</h5>
<p>Where the Professional Services shall be performed by accessing the network system of Customer or a thirty-party appointed by Customer (collectively referred to as “<strong>Customer System</strong>”), Customer shall grant TeamViewer, its auxiliary personnel and subcontractors prompt and unimpeded access to such system and its components.</p>
<p>In case of technical problems with the hardware or software components of Customer System during the Professional Services, Customer will provide expert technical assistance at its own expense. During the Professional Services, Customer will guarantee the availability of at least one employee who is familiar with Customer’s computer systems and processes and who, upon request, will be able to give expert advice and information.</p>
<p>Customer shall promptly notify TeamViewer of any disruptions, shutdowns or disassembly of Customer System or any IT infrastructural changes which could make it harder or impossible for TeamViewer to perform the Professional Services.</p>
<h5>E.3.4 Data backups</h5>
<p>Customer shall be solely responsible for making proper data backups in the Customer System in accordance with the current state of technology and industrial common practice. If Customer has otherwise contractually tasked TeamViewer with a data backup service, the content and scope of the data backup by TeamViewer shall be defined exclusively by such separate contract.</p>
<h5>E.3.5 Software version; installation</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise agreed to by the Parties, the Professional Services in relation to the Software (e. g. installation, configuration, application, integration, update), will be provided for the most current version of the Software. Customer is committed to the fulfilment and maintenance of the System Requirements as set out in the EULA for the respective Software. In case that the installation and/or update of the Software is not part of the Professional Services, Customer shall ensure that it has the respective Software installed and updated to the then-current version on its computers (desktop PC or notebook) or mobile devices (e.g. iOS, Android) for the duration of the Professional Services.</p>
<h5>E.3.6 Consequences of non-compliance</h5>
<p>If Customer fails to meet its obligations under this section E.3, Customer shall bear all the associated risks and losses.</p>
<p>If TeamViewer is unable to perform the Professional Services on time or properly for reasons for which the Customer is responsible (e. g. as a result of incorrect, incomplete or delayed provision of services or materials), TeamViewer shall not be liable for any delays as a result thereof and shall be entitled to charge the resulting additional expenses and costs at its applicable rates.</p>
<h5>E.3.7 Failure of Third-Party Service Recipient</h5>
<p>Should the Professional Services be carried out with a Third-Party Service Recipient pursuant to section E.1.5, Customer shall ensure that the Third-Party Service Recipient fulfils the requirements and duties set out herein above. Failure of Third-Party Service Recipient in compliance therewith shall be deemed as Customer´s own failure.</p>
<h4>E.4. Personnel; Sub-contractor</h4>
<h5>E.4.1 Free choice</h5>
<p>TeamViewer shall be free to choose the persons it employs to perform the Professional Services. TeamViewer shall ensure that the persons employed are sufficiently qualified to perform the service. TeamViewer shall be entitled to use subcontractors for the provision of services, including affiliated companies within the meaning of sections 15 et seq. AktG (German Stock Corporation Act).</p>
<h5>E.4.2 No hiring</h5>
<p>The persons engaged by TeamViewer to perform the Professional Services are not subject to the authority of the Customer to issue instructions. This shall apply in particular if persons engaged by TeamViewer perform the Professional Services on the Customer’s premises. Both parties shall take appropriate measures to prevent the hiring out of employees (<em>Arbeitnehmerüberlassung</em>).</p>
<h4>E.5. Remuneration</h4>
<h5>E.5.1 Service fees; reimbursement of expenses</h5>
<p>Unless otherwise explicitly stipulated in the respective Contract, the Professional Services shall be remunerated on a time and material basis and invoiced to Customer on a monthly or quarterly basis as chosen by TeamViewer. Billing shall be based on the number of working days performed by TeamViewer. The fees payable for the Professional Services shall be calculated at the then current daily or hourly fee rates for the personnel of TeamViewer. A working day shall be eight (8) hours. Additional or reduced services per working day shall be remunerated pro rata.</p>
<p>In addition, TeamViewer shall be entitled to reimbursement of the expenses necessary and proven for the provision of the services, including travel expenses, as provided in the Contract.</p>
<h5>E.5.2 Travel expenses</h5>
<p>The costs for the travel, overnight stay, catering and any other incidental costs (“<strong>Travel Expenses</strong>”) of the TeamViewer service team will be charged separately to the fees payable for the Professional Services. If not agreed otherwise, the following calculation basis will apply for the invoicing of the Travel Expenses:</p>
<p>Flight: Economy Class;</p>
<p>Train: Second class, plus additional costs for seat reservations;</p>
<p>Car: 35 Cent per kilometre for the arrival and departure by car as well as all drives which are related directly to the Professional Services (e.g. from the hotel to the place where the Professional Services takes place);</p>
<p>Taxi: All costs for all taxi drives which are related directly to the Professional Services;</p>
<p>Rental car: All costs for a rental car of the mid-size category without deductible and with unlimited mileage as well as all fuel costs incurred herewith;</p>
<p>Hotel: A single room in a three-star hotel with breakfast will be booked for each TeamViewer service team member for the entire duration of the stay;</p>
<p>Catering: If the duration of the Professional Services will be one working day, the price for the catering will be EUR 14,00 per TeamViewer service team member. If the duration of the Professional Services will be longer than one working day, the price for the catering will be EUR 28,00 per day and per TeamViewer service team member. The price for the catering will also be charged for the day of arrival and for the day of departure of the TeamViewer service team;</p>
<p>Other incidental costs: All incurred incidental costs and fees, including, but not limited to, toll fees, highway badges, costs for bridges and ferries.</p>
<h5>E.5.3 Cost Estimate</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may quote a cost estimate for the provision of Professional Services in a specific project (“<strong>Cost Estimate</strong>”), including the applicable expenses, if any, and service fees calculated on the basis of a time budget estimated by TeamViewer with its experience in previous similar cases. Save as otherwise stipulated explicitly in the Contract, such time budget shall not be interpreted as a limitation of chargeable service fees. If it turns out during the performance of Professional Services that the quoted time budget is not sufficient for the completion of the project, TeamViewer shall notify Customer and propose a reasonable adjustment of the Cost Estimate in a timely manner.</p>
<h4>E.6. Intellectual Property Rights; use right</h4>
<h5>E.6.1 Materials</h5>
<p>TeamViewer may create, develop, supplement, deliver or provide access to, literary works and/or other works of authorship, e. g. software programs (including without limitation to specific or customized versions or applications of Software), program listings, programming tools, documentation, reports, databases, drawings and similar works (collectively “<strong>Materials</strong>“) to Customer in frame of the Professional Services for the purpose of testing, analysis or demonstrating a proof of concept. The Professional Services does not include the transfer of titles or intellectual property rights in the Materials. As between the parties, all ownership rights and intellectual property rights (including copyrights and rights of use and exploitation) in and to the Materials shall remain with TeamViewer at any time during and after the performance of the Professional Services.</p>
<p>To the extent required to provide the Professional Services, TeamViewer grants Customer a non-exclusive right to use the Materials according to Part B of this EULA for the term during which TeamViewer provides the Professional Services to Customer. For clarity, if Customer has already acquired an appropriate license to use the Materials, wholly or partly, such license shall take precedence of the license grant under this section E.6.1.</p>
<h5>E.6.2 Work Results</h5>
<p>Save otherwise provided in the Contract, as between the parties, TeamViewer is, or shall become as of creation, the sole and exclusive owner of any and all intellectual property rights, including copyrights and rights of use and exploitation, in the work products arising from its performance of Professional Services, in particular software programs (object and source code) and applications, customization, configuration, implementation, settings, improvement, development of features, in relation to the Software, as well as other work products provided by TeamViewer, e. g. documentation, tools, solutions, test results, analysis and know-how (collectively the “<strong>Work Results</strong>”). If and to the extent any right, title and interest in and to any intellectual property in the Software or Work Results are vested in Customer for any reason, Customer hereby assigns to TeamViewer and TeamViewer hereby accepts any such right, title and interest with effect as of the time of its creation. For the avoidance of doubt, TeamViewer especially reserves the rights to make available any Work Results, or parts thereof, to third parties, e. g. TeamViewer customers, provided such use by TeamViewer shall not infringe any intellectual property rights or business secrets of the Customer. To the extent legally possible, Customer hereby irrevocably waives and agrees never to assert and enforce in any manner any moral rights (<em>Urheberpersönlichkeitsrechte</em>) that it may be entitled to in the Software or Work Results, against TeamViewer, any of TeamViewer’s affiliates or successors in interest, or any of TeamViewer’s, its affiliates’ or successors’ customers.</p>
<p>Any right of Customer to use any Work Results shall be subject to a license agreement between the parties. If and to the extent the Work Results relate to an implementation, extension or improvement of Customer´s use of Services, for which Customer has already acquired an appropriate Subscription License from TeamViewer pursuant to section B, such License shall also apply to the use of the related Work Results, unless otherwise agreed by the parties.</p>
<h4>E.7. Warranty</h4>
<h5>E.7.1 Warranty Period</h5>
<p>TeamViewer warrants that it performs each Professional Services using reasonable care and skill of a professional service provider. Any claims for the breach of warranty shall be time-barred by six (6) months from the completion of the applicable Professional Services (the “<strong>Warranty Period</strong>”). If during the Warranty Period, Supplier receives written notice from Customer and to the extent that the claimed breach is proven as exiting in the performance of the Professional Services, Supplier will, at its sole option, promptly re-perform any Professional Services that fail to meet this warranty or refund pro-rata the fees paid for the part of non-conforming Professional Services. This section sets out the sole and exclusive remedies available to Customer based on a breach of Warranty above.</p>
<h5>E.7.2 No commitment</h5>
<p>TeamViewer will not warrant or commit that: i) it will be able to correct all reported defects; or ii) the use of the Products or any other deliverables will be uninterrupted or error free; or iii) the results of the Professional Services will meet the requirements or expectation of Customer, or will serve the intended use or business purposes of Customer.
